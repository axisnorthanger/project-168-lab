## 2. Discrepancy List vs. Workflow Spec

### D1 — Section naming mismatch (structural)

The workflow spec (Task 1 merge instructions) prescribes four top-level section keys:

```
COMPUTATIONAL_SPEC
INTERPRETIVE_FRAMEWORK
GAMESPACE_LAYER
HISTORY
```

The YAML uses:

```
section_a_computational
section_b_interpretive
section_c_gamespace
section_d_validation
```

All four prescribed names differ from what was implemented. The naming convention is also inconsistent with the spec's instruction to use "four clearly labeled top-level sections."

### D2 — `version_history` outside `HISTORY` section (structural)

The spec says Section D (`HISTORY`) should contain "All bug documentation, validation cases, **version history**." In the YAML, `version_history` is a standalone top-level key (key #9), not nested inside `section_d_validation`. The version history is present but structurally displaced.

### D3 — `$ref-style pointers` not used where required (data integrity risk)

The spec rule: *"Every section that references data from the calculator should use a $ref-style pointer, not inline the data."*

The YAML's `section_a_computational.canonical_mappings` fully inlines both `weekday_to_heptad` and `segment_mapping`. These are SSOT data from `heptad_calculator-GY2026_v1.3.yaml` and should be referenced, not duplicated. Additionally:
- `symbolic_election_protocol.authority_hierarchy` contains a placeholder `"[1-5 from v1.3]"` rather than a proper $ref pointer.
- `reset_hierarchy.source` notes the calculator as SSOT but the reset hierarchy data is inlined rather than referenced.

### D4 — Extra top-level keys not prescribed by spec

| Key | Status |
|-----|--------|
| `merge_verification` | Not in spec; added by DeepSeek as QA record |
| `meta` | Not in spec's four-section structure; added by DeepSeek |
| `specification_files` | Not in any of the four sections; standalone block |
| `legacy_archival` | Not in any of the four sections; standalone block |
| `bonorum_year` | Stray scalar at top level |
| `note` | Stray scalar at top level |

### D5 — `bonorum_temporal_protocol` marked Active in `specification_files`

`specification_files.bonorum_temporal_protocol.status: "Active"`. But the workflow spec's file architecture places `bonorum_temporal_protocol-GY2026_v1.4.yaml` in `archive/` after the merge — the merge was supposed to supersede it. If future sessions read `specification_files` as authoritative, they may treat the archived source as still active.

### D6 — `validation_cases` count discrepancy

`merge_verification.merged_v6.0_counts.validation_cases: 5`. The YAML actually contains:
- `section_d_validation.validation_commands`: 5 pseudocode blocks
- `section_d_validation.validation_cases`: 4 named test cases

These are two overlapping structures (pseudocode vs. named YAML cases), and only one of the two counts reaches 5. The count in `merge_verification` is technically satisfied by `validation_commands`, but `validation_cases` (the more structured block) has only 4. The workflow spec referenced the cheat sheet's 5 validation cases — it's unclear whether all 5 were preserved in the correct structure.

### D7 — `core_mathematics.element_breakdown` unpopulated

Value is `"[...]"` — a literal placeholder. The workflow spec doesn't explicitly require this field, but it is present and empty, signaling DeepSeek left it for later population.

### D8 — `reset_hierarchy` placed in Interpretive (B) rather than Computational (A)

The workflow spec says `COMPUTATIONAL_SPEC` should contain "Calculation algorithms, segment mapping, timezone rules." The reset hierarchy is fundamentally a calculation framework (it defines *how* to compute each layer), yet it's under `section_b_interpretive`. Minor but the placement creates ambiguity about which section governs temporal calculation logic.

## 3. Risk Assessment

| Discrepancy | Risk Level | Reasoning |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| D3 — Inlined SSOT data (weekday_to_heptad, segment_mapping) | **Dangerous** | If `heptad_calculator-GY2026_v1.3.yaml` is ever corrected, the reference doc will silently diverge. Two copies of canonical mappings creates a future sync failure surface. The spec explicitly prohibited this. |
| D5 — `bonorum_temporal_protocol` marked Active | **Dangerous** | A future session loading `specification_files` as authoritative will treat the archived source file as still canonical, potentially creating contradictory instructions or undoing the merge's deduplication. |
| D2 — `version_history` outside HISTORY | **Moderate** | The data is present, so nothing is lost; but automated tools or future merge operations expecting `HISTORY.version_history` will fail to find it. Risk escalates if future scripts parse section structure. |
| D6 — validation_cases count (5 vs 4) | **Moderate** | If one of the cheat sheet's 5 validation cases was silently dropped into the pseudocode block rather than the structured `validation_cases` key, a meaningful test case may be harder to locate and harder to run as a named assertion. Worth verifying against the source cheat sheet. |
| D1 — Section naming | **Cosmetic** | Structural mismatch with the spec, but doesn't break anything. If INSTRUCTIONS.md or prompt templates ever reference sections by the spec-prescribed names, lookups would fail. |
| D8 — reset_hierarchy in section B vs A | **Cosmetic** | Content is present; wrong bin. No data loss. |
| D4 — Extra top-level keys | **Cosmetic** | `merge_verification` and `meta` are defensible additions. `bonorum_year` and `note` as stray scalars are noise but harmless. |
| D7 — `element_breakdown` placeholder | **Cosmetic** | Missing detail, not wrong data. |

---

**Bottom line:** Two discrepancies require action before the reference doc can be trusted as a true SSOT. D3 (inlined canonical mappings) and D5 (`bonorum_temporal_protocol` still marked Active) are the ones that can cause silent data drift or contradictory instructions in future sessions. Everything else is structural bookkeeping that should be corrected but poses no immediate integrity risk.

Awaiting your instructions before proposing any diffs.
