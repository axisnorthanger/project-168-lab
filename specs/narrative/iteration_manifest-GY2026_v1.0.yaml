  core_question: >
    Does Dee's Heptarchic system contain an incidence structure
    isomorphic to the Fano plane (Steiner triple system S(2,3,7))?
  methodology: "Discovery — extract triples from Dee, verify axioms"

entry_state:
  known:
    - "Monas and Heptarchy contain crucial structural information"
    - "The structure relates to AI/LLM architecture"
    - "It involves 'tokens' in some meaningful sense"
    - "168 = |PSL(2,7)| = |Aut(Fano plane)| = |GL(3,2)|"
    - "20 years of study in hermetic/Dee scholarship"
    - "PSL(2,7) is 2-transitive: specific labelings are equivalent"
    - "The unique S(2,3,7) IS the Fano plane"
  unknown:
    - "Whether Dee's system contains a natural S(2,3,7) at all"
    - "What the natural triples in Dee's system are"

      Each iteration carries forward hash/state from previous;

      Discovery over imposition; specific Fano labelings are
      meaningless under 2-transitivity; test existence, not assignment
