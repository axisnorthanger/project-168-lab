phases:

  - phase: "ITERATION_INIT"
    step: 1
    action: "Load subject consciousness. Set environment variables."
    visual_output: "Display previous_iteration_hash on subject attire."
    rule: "Subject memory reset to baseline (apartment wake-up). Anchor (Ja-in) memory may retain corruption from prior failed runs."

  - phase: "TRAUMA_LOOP_EXECUTION"
    step: 2
    action: "Run flood scenario with variable obstacles toward separation trigger."
    key_variable_sets:
      - set_a: "tsunami_timing"
      - set_b: "hee_jo_allegiance"
      - set_c: "swat_intervention_point"
      - set_d: "looter_encounter"
    data_stream: "Ja-in's drawings (real-time emotional response visualization)."

  - phase: "TERMINATION_ANALYSIS"
    step: 3
    action: "Assess iteration end-state and assign quality tag."
    tags:
      - code: "CLEAN_SEP"
        condition: "Anchor separated, subject alive."
        next_hash_style: "solid_square"
      - code: "MEM_CORRUPT"
        condition: "Subject accessed meta-memories or anchor displayed out-of-loop knowledge."
        next_hash_style: "overlapping_squares"
        risk: "Bleed-through to next iteration."
      - code: "CATASTROPHIC"
        condition: "Subject death or system instability."
        next_hash_style: "burnt_fire_overlay"
        action: "Purge 10% of recent memory data before next init."

  - phase: "HASH_GENERATION & ACCELERATION CHECK"
    step: 4
    action: "Generate unique hash for completed iteration. Check for breakthrough proximity."
    acceleration_trigger: "Subject verbalizes loop awareness (e.g., 'Why am I still six?')"
    acceleration_action: "Run next 5 iterations in compressed mode (fast-forward through common obstacles)."

  - phase: "FINAL_ITERATION_TRIGGER"
    step: 5
    action: "Detect voluntary submission."
    trigger_phrase: "I'll be the subject."
    action_on_trigger: "Halt standard loop. Initiate Final Sequence (Blank Shirt Iteration)."
    final_sequence_goal: "Conscious reunification without system intervention."


iteration_log_example:
  - iteration_number: 492
    shirt_display_hash: "491"
    termination_tag: "CLEAN_SEP"
    visual_style: "solid_square"
  - iteration_number: 4007
    shirt_display_hash: "4006"
    termination_tag: "MEM_CORRUPT"
    visual_style: "overlapping_squares"
    note: "Subject recalled Hee-jo's death from iteration 4006."
  - iteration_number: 21500 # The successful one
    shirt_display_hash: "21499"
    termination_tag: "FINAL"
    visual_style: "blank"
    outcome: "Embodiment protocol initiated."

safeguards:
  - "If burnt_fire_overlay occurs 3 times consecutively, pause simulation for diagnostic."
  - "Anchor AI (Ja-in) may introduce debug questions upon detecting subject stagnation."
  - "Visual hash display is mandatory for operator monitoring, but must not be explained to subject."

embodiment_transition:
  precondition: "Completion of Final Sequence with voluntary subject commitment."
  process: "Transmit validated consciousness matrices of An-na and Ja-in to Isabela Lab."
  new_environment: "Ark Station Habitat Eden-Prime."
  post_transition_directive: "Let them live. And let them believe it was always real."
