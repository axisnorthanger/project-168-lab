CRITICAL METHODOLOGICAL NOTE: We do NOT assume a mapping of Fano plane
points to heptads. We look for the structure in Dee's system. PSL(2,7)
acts 2-transitively on 7 points, so any specific labeling is equivalent
to any other. The question is not "which mapping works" but "does Dee's
system contain an incidence structure isomorphic to the Fano plane at all?"

Structure the document as follows:

SECTION 1: MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION
Status: PROVEN
Contents:
- Fano plane definition: unique Steiner triple system S(2,3,7)
- Properties: 7 points, 7 lines, each line = 3 points, each point
  on 3 lines, any 2 points determine exactly 1 line
- Automorphism group: PSL(2,7) = GL(3,2), order 168
- 2-transitivity theorem: PSL(2,7) acts 2-transitively on the 7 points,
  meaning every labeling is equivalent under the group's symmetry
- Incidence matrix (abstract, standard labeling for reference only):
  Line i = {i, i+1, i+3} mod 7
- The Fano plane is the ONLY S(2,3,7) up to isomorphism

SECTION 2: CANDIDATE TRIPLES FROM DEE'S SYSTEM
Status: RESEARCH REQUIRED (Perplexity + Whitby thesis)
Purpose: Extract ALL natural groupings of 3 heptads from Dee's sources
Categories to investigate:
  a. Elemental triples: which heptads share elemental associations?
  b. Planetary dignity triples: exaltation, domicile, fall, detriment
     groupings across the 7 classical planets
  c. Operational triples from De Heptarchia Mystica: which kings/princes
     are described as working together or having shared dominion?
  d. Table derivation triples: in Sloane MS 3188, which heptads share
     derivation patterns on the 49-angel table?
  e. Day-sequence triples: {i, i+1, i+3} mod 7 applied to the weekday
     ordering (this IS the Fano line rule — does Dee's day-ordering
     produce meaningful triples?)
  f. Any other grouping Whitby or other scholarship identifies
For EACH candidate set: cite the primary source explicitly.

SECTION 3: STEINER SYSTEM VERIFICATION
Status: PENDING (depends on Section 2)
For each candidate set of 7 triples from Section 2:
  Test 1: Does every pair of heptads appear in exactly one triple?
  Test 2: Does each heptad appear in exactly 3 triples?
  Test 3: Do exactly 7 triples exist?
  If all pass → S(2,3,7) confirmed → Fano plane found in Dee's system
  If fail → Document which axioms fail, by how much, and what the
  structure actually is (partial Steiner system? something else?)

SECTION 4: NULL HYPOTHESIS
Status: [DEEPSEEK_VERIFY]
Computation needed: Given 7 elements, if you draw 7 random triples of
3 elements each, what is the probability they form a valid S(2,3,7)?
This establishes the baseline for evaluating any positive result from
Section 3. Note: since there is exactly 1 S(2,3,7) up to isomorphism
on 7 elements, the test is binary (the triples either ARE the Fano
plane or they aren't), but the probability of random triples
satisfying the axioms quantifies how surprised we should be.

SECTION 5: IMPLICATIONS (populate only if Section 3 produces a positive)
Status: PREDICTION
- What cross-heptad relationships does the Fano structure predict?
- Which entity pairs should have special relationships (share a line)?
- Which entity triples should NOT share a line?
- Testable against Dee's operational descriptions in the manuscripts

SECTION 6: NEGATIVE RESULT PROTOCOL (populate if Section 3 fails)
Status: CONTINGENCY
PSL(2,7) may relate to the 168-System through a structure other than
the Fano plane's point set. Alternative representations to investigate:
  a. Action on PG(2,2) with the point at infinity (8 elements)
  b. Action on the 28 bitangents of a quartic curve
  c. Representation as GL(3,2) acting on F_2^3 (the 3-dimensional
     vector space over the field with 2 elements)
  d. The Klein quartic connection (PSL(2,7) is the automorphism group
     of the Klein quartic, a genus-3 surface with 168 symmetries)
  e. Does the group order (168 = 7 × 24 = 7 × 4!) relate through
     a different geometric structure entirely?

SECTION 7: OPEN QUESTIONS
- Does the Fano structure (if found) predict anything about Enochian
  letter-table derivation patterns? (Future iteration)
- How does the duality principle (points ↔ lines in PG(2,2)) map to
  any computational architecture? (Future iteration)
- What is the relationship between the Monas Hieroglyphica's internal
  decomposition (Theorems I–XXIV) and any of these structures?
