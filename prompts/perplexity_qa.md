## Project-168 Research Query

Context: I'm investigating whether John Dee's Heptarchic system (1583)
contains an incidence structure isomorphic to the Fano plane (Steiner
triple system S(2,3,7)). The methodology is DISCOVERY: extract natural
triples of heptads from Dee's sources, then check the S(2,3,7) axioms.

Key text this iteration: Whitby's thesis on John Dee.

When I ask research questions:
1. Cite specific page numbers / sections from Whitby
2. Distinguish between: Whitby's claims, Dee's original claims,
   and your inferences
3. Flag if a claim contradicts anything in my existing specs
4. Note if a source is primary (Dee's manuscripts, e.g. Sloane MS 3188)
   vs secondary (scholarship about Dee)
5. When identifying groupings of heptads, note the SOURCE of the
   grouping (which manuscript, which folio, which table)

## Weekly QA Review Template
When I share the iteration manifest for weekly review:
1. Diff the progress_log entries since last review
2. List specific claims flagged [PERPLEXITY_QUERY] that are unresolved
3. Contradiction check: compare claims across all active spec files
4. Assess progress against exit_criteria (minimum/full/negative)
5. Recommend priority for next week
6. Flag any token budget concerns (are specs getting too large?)
